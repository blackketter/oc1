By accessing the content contained in the digital archive with this Agreement or by using the chumby HDK, you are indicating that you have read and understood, and assent to be bound by, the terms of this Agreement. If you are an individual working for a company, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary authority to bind your company to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

1. Introduction.

What this Agreement is:

Under this Agreement, as set out below, chumby grants you a license to use the chumby HDK to hack your chumby Device. In return, we ask that you: keep the chumby Service on an even playing field with any other service you want to point your chumby Device to; grant us a license related to your modifications and derivatives, when and if you make them available to others; and agree to the other terms below.

What this Agreement is not:

This Agreement is about the materials we provide for people who want to hack their chumby Devices. It is not about the widgets that run on your chumby Device. We provide some widgets, and help people share widgets, on our website under the website terms of service at http://www.chumby.com/corporate/terms_of_use.

This Agreement is not a license to use chumby's brand or to manufacture and sell chumby Devices.

This Agreement is not a software license. Most of the software delivered on the chumby Device is licensed (by chumby or third parties) under free or open source license terms. See http://www.chumby.com/developers/licenses for details. This Agreement does not modify your rights under the licenses for such third-party free and open source software.

Contact us if you want to do something different: Our goal is to give our Licensees latitude to modify their chumby Devices and the chumby software that runs on them, while preserving our business of running the chumby Service. Our business and licensing models are under development, though, and we are open to talking about additional uses of our technology. So, if you have an idea that does not seem to be covered by these licenses, please contact chumby. Now, on to the legalese...
